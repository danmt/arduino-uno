# Temperature Control System v1

The intention of this exercise is to set up a Temperature Control System using a Dallas 18b20 Temperature sensor and a 12v Fan using an ULN2003 module.

The PINs being used are:

- PIN #2 as OneWire.
- PIN 5V for constant power.
- PIN #5 for digital write to turn on/off the fan.

It's also possible to set up a minimum and maximum temperatures range so the fan automatically turns on/off depending on the sensor.
